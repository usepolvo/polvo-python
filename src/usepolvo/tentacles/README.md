# Tentacles

This directory contains the individual API integrations for usepolvo-python. Each subdirectory represents a different third-party service integration, with resource-specific modules organized within.

## Directory Structure Explanation

- Each integration (e.g., `certn`, `stripe`) has its own directory.
- Within each integration directory:
  - `client.py`: Contains the main client class for the API.
  - `config.py`: Configuration settings specific to this integration.
  - `exceptions.py`: Custom exceptions for this integration.
  - Resource-specific directories (e.g., `applications`, `customers`):
    - `client.py`: Contains the client class for this specific resource.
    - `schemas.py`: Data models and schemas for this resource.

## Adding a New Integration

To add a new API integration:

1. Create a new directory with the name of the service (e.g., `new_service/`).
2. Add the main `client.py`, `config.py`, and `exceptions.py` files.
3. For each major resource or endpoint:
   - Create a new subdirectory (e.g., `users/`, `products/`).
   - Within the subdirectory, create `client.py` and `schemas.py`.
4. Implement the `BaseClient` class from `usepolvo.arms.base_client` in your service's main client.
5. Use the utilities in `usepolvo.ink` for common operations.

## Guidelines

- Keep each service's implementation isolated within its own directory.
- Implement consistent interfaces across different services and resources where possible.
- Use async/await for all API calls to ensure non-blocking operations.
- Implement proper error handling and use custom exceptions from both the main `exceptions.py` and `usepolvo.beak.exceptions`.
- Ensure that resource-specific clients inherit from or utilize the main service client.

## Testing

- Add corresponding test files in the `tests/tentacles/` directory for any new integrations or modifications.
- Create separate test files for each resource client and schema.
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage for both the main service functionality and individual resource operations.

## Documentation

- Keep docstrings updated in all client classes and methods.
- Consider adding a brief README.md file in each integration directory to explain service-specific details or configuration requirements.

Remember to keep this structure consistent across all integrations to maintain a uniform and easily navigable codebase.
